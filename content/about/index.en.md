Hello, I'm Raúl.

I created this blog to document projects, lessons learned, and the reasoning behind technical decisions. For years I built things, solved problems, and moved on without writing any of it down.

I care a lot about the **why** behind solutions. Once you understand the why, implementation gets simpler, and you keep that knowledge for the next problem.

This space is where I share those whys, along with practical write-ups and ideas from my day-to-day work.

Kind regards,

Raúl Correia
