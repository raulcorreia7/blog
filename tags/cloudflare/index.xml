&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revamp focused on four things that actually matter: domain ownership, maintainability, deployment reliability, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did this full revamp with the aid of AI, mainly to move faster on repetitive work while I kept the technical decisions and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog was online, but the setup was fragile: CI/CD was failing, the build pipeline was outdated, key dependencies were unmaintained, and the old theme was no longer healthy to keep evolving. I wanted to fix that properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
